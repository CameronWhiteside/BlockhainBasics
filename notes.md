Smart Contracts are contracts with terms written in code.

Etherium is an asset and a utility to build smart contracts.

These blockchanis are deterministic, so they're a walled garden. They need some way to access the outside world with Oracles. They are devices that bring data in or execute external computation, but since the app in decentralized, their data also needs to be decentralized as well.

Chainlink is a decentralized, modular Oracle network to bring data into smart contracts and do external computations. Chainlink allows for unlimited smart contract customization.

Dapp = Smart Contract = Decentralized App
